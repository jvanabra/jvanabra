The preamble to the Constitution of the United States of America begins with the famous words: "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America." The preamble sets the tone and outlines the purpose of the Constitution, emphasizing the principles of unity, justice, peace, defense, welfare, liberty, and the desire to secure these ideals for both the present and future generations.

We are born of contrast and connection.
